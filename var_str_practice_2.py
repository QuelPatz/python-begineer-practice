#Write a Python program that uses three variables. The variables in your program will be animal,
#vegetable, and mineral. Assign a string value to each one of the variables. Your program should
#display "Here is an animal, a vegetable, and a mineral." Next, display the value for animal,
#followed by vegetable, and finally mineral. Each one of the values should be printed on their
#own line. Your program will display four lines in total.

#sentence = 'Here is an animal, a vegetable, and a mineral.'
#animal = 'cat'
#vegetable = 'broccoli'
#mineral = 'gold'

#print(sentence)
#print(animal)
#print(vegetable)
#print(mineral)
